// Retrieval -> H2O -> Recency when the query embedding is flat or absent (`kvmem_store.hpp:140-143`),
// and the first re-selection after a prefill has no query at all. With the direction backwards we
// would keep the OLDEST candidates and evict the NEWEST, which is the opposite of what the recency
// fallback exists for.

// The order is TOTAL either way: block ids are unique, so no two candidates compare equal and the
// selected SET cannot depend on the order std::nth_element happened to shuffle equal elements into.
// (An earlier revision of this comment claimed only an id-ASCENDING rule is deterministic. That
// argument was wrong -- id-descending is just as total. Determinism comes from totality, not from its
