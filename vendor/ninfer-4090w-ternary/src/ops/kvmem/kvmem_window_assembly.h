// KVMem window assembly: the MISSING PATH between "the blocks the retriever chose" and "the page
// table the attention reads".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
//   An engine audit (exp\kvmem-reuse\ vs exp\kvmem-enginecache, 2026-09-21) found that the engine can
//   already express a window and already owns every part of one, but has NO path that turns a SCORE
//   DRIVEN block selection into one. Two capabilities are absent, and they are the whole of what KVMem
//   adds here:
//       ① a re-RoPE consumer that re-bakes a key to its new window position (ops\kvmem\rerope), and
//       ② this one -- the selection path: selection -> placement -> page table.
//   Everything else already exists and must NOT be rebuilt (the port discipline is explicit: "do not
//   build a new host layer"; hang on the engine's existing page pool + execution table + address
//   space). So this file contains exactly the missing middle sentence:
//
//       block id -> physical page slot -> published at the slot's WINDOW position
//
// THE ONE INVARIANT THAT MAKES IT CORRECT (and the failure it prevents)
//   The window is a CONTIGUOUS PREFIX whose live positions are SEQUENTIAL -- that is the engine's
//   contract, not a preference (`include\infer\ops\softmax_attention.h:118-123`: "Each masked row has
//   a live prefix [0,Vb); its live positions are sequential"), and the main path passes the mask
//   EMPTY (`text_context_impl.h:1023`), so visibility is decided by positions alone. Therefore the
//   window's slot order is CHRONOLOGICAL (ascending block id) and is NOT the retrieval score order.
//   The reference says the same thing in its own words (`qw3\kvmem_store.hpp:128-131`: the remap list
//   is "in window order", `:469-470` "it is sorted ascending internally so window order is
//   deterministic (sink first ... recent last) ... packed contiguously from window pos 0").
//
//   Getting this wrong produces a window that is FULL, VALID and WRONG: every slot holds a genuinely
//   selected block, no counter disagrees, no error is raised, and the answer is garbage. That is
//   exactly the failure mode this project keeps paying for (the empty-window/self-consistent-counters
//   bug in `kvmem_select.cpp:106-126`, and the "publish() is a pure overwrite so a half-reassembled
//   window still looks complete" hazard in exp\kvmem-stage0). So the order is CHECKED here rather than
//   assumed by the caller, and `order_error()` exists so a judge can assert the check has teeth.
//
// A HOLE IS AN ERROR, NOT A GAP
//   If a selected block has no live page, we THROW. Dropping it is the tempting alternative and it is
//   the wrong one: the window would then be a prefix of a different sequence, so its positions would
//   still be sequential and every downstream check would pass, while the model silently attends to a
//   history it was never given. `assemble_window()` already refuses unset/stale/not-device-resident
//   handles, but it can only see the slots it is handed -- it cannot notice a slot that should have
//   been handed to it. That check belongs here, where the selection is still in hand.
//
// HOST-ONLY ON PURPOSE
//   This header includes nothing but the standard library and `kvmem_select.h`. The physical slots
//   arrive as an abstract `BlockPageSource`, so the placement can be exercised with no CUDA context
//   and no GPU at all -- the property whose absence is why this project's MeanKIndex had never been
//   executed before its own round. The judge that drives the REAL page pool is a separate driver
//   (`exp\kvmem-select-assemble\`), because driving the pool is a different kind of evidence.

// `slot` is the pool's PHYSICAL page index (`DeviceKVPagePool::physical_index()`), which is exactly
// what `KVExecutionTablePool::publish()` consumes -- it converts each handle through that same call
// (`core\paged_kv_cache.cpp:774-789`). A negative slot means "not resident": the block exists in the
// history but has no page the attention could read, which is a hole (see above).
//
// During the port `slots_in_window_order` holds the caller's own handle indices; at the wiring point
// they are physical page indices. Nothing here depends on which, which is the point.

// ★★ TWO DIFFERENT THINGS GET CONFUSED HERE, AND THE CONFUSION IS SILENT. This header used to mix
//    them up itself, and the first judge written against it went red for the wrong reason:
//
//      - a block's POSITION in the selection (`kvmem_select` emits ascending block IDS, and their
//        position within that emitted list is NOT the id -- {0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,12,13,14,15} has
//        position 4 at id 5); and
//      - a block's slot lookup, which is keyed by ID.
//
//    The assembly consumes the FIRST (one entry per emitted block, in order) and the caller owns the
//    SECOND (id -> slot). Handing the assembly an id-keyed table as if it were position-indexed
//    produces a perfect-looking plan built from the wrong pages -- no error, no counter disagreement.
//    So the two are separate types below and the adapter between them is explicit and named.

// 1b. ★ The table the ENGINE does not have yet: block id -> where that block's pages live
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `BlockPageTable` above is the right SHAPE but the wrong CONTENT for the wiring point: its rows are
// page indices the caller already knows, whereas the engine's real question is "which of my pages
// currently holds block b's key/value" -- and that answer changes the moment a tier moves a block.
//
// The ported policy layer already carries exactly that field (`qw3\kvmem_store.hpp:53`,
// `KvMemBlock::gpu_slot`), the sibling implementation builds the same thing as
// `slot_of_block[block_id]` + a freelist (`E:\外部资料\...\docs\modification-plan.md`), and the
// official layer's remap list already keys on block id (`KvMemRemap::block_id`). So this type adds NO
// new concept; it is the engine-side half of a mapping the policy layer has been reserving a field
// for since it was ported.
//
// WHY IT CARRIES AN EPOCH, AND WHY THAT IS NOT OPTIONAL
//   A block's page identity is (position, generation). Without the generation, the failure below is
//   INVISIBLE: stage a block out, let its page be rematerialized for another block, then read the map
//   again -- the block is still "registered", the page number is still a legal page, and the window
//   built from it is full, valid and WRONG. That is the same silent-wrong-answer family as the
//   position/id mix-up, one tier further out, and it becomes reachable the moment `stage_out` exists.
//   So the epoch is part of validity, not a diagnostic: `Slot(0)` means "the source cannot tell me"
//   and checks only the registration.

// a FINAL answer: the engine CAN bring a block back, it just has to be asked. The engine's own restore
// transaction does exactly this three-step dance (`program_impl.h:4949-4982`, spent on checkpoints):
//
//     reserve_device_replica(logical, reservation)   -> a destination page + the "destination pinned"
//     <host-to-device copy of the replica's extent>  -> the caller performs this
//     publish_device_replica(logical)                -> the destination becomes the device replica
//
// with `abort_device_replica(logical, reservation)` as the failure path. That is the whole of stage-in
// at the address layer; what this section adds is the ORCHESTRATION (which blocks, in which order, and
// what "it worked" means) plus the refusal to assemble while any hole remains.
//
// WHY A SEAM AND NOT A DIRECT CALL. The stager lives in the target tree
// (`targets/qwen3_6/impl/runtime/logical_kv_store.h`), which an ops-layer header must not include --
// and the discipline this whole port has followed is that the placement is checkable with no GPU and

// block be staged in?" and, after materialization, "which page is it now?" -- in one value that is
// also a legal slot number's neighbour. That is the §5.18 family (`position != block id`) one layer
// out, and it is why the composition below exists: the two questions are asked in the two places that
// can actually answer them, in the only order that works.
