// KVMem re-RoPE consumer (host-safe contract). Device half: kvmem_rerope_launch.cu.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
//   Our engine's visible set is a CONTIGUOUS PREFIX by contract
//   (include/ninfer/ops/softmax_attention.h:118-123: "query head h attends cache rows [0,p]",
//   "live positions are sequential"), and there is no per-cell mask anywhere in the tree. A KVMem
//   block selection therefore cannot be expressed as holes: the selected pages must be ASSEMBLED
//   INTO A COMPACT WINDOW. The K in those pages was baked by RoPE at its ORIGINAL position, so
//   moving a page to a new window position requires re-baking its K at the new one. This file is
//   that consumer. Assembling the bytes at the new window slots (the page-table move) is stage 2a's
//   job, not this file's.
//
// ONE PATH, NOT TWO — the in-place code-rotation path was DROPPED, and here is why
//   The cheap-looking design rotates the stored fp8 CODES in place (de-rotate by the old position,
//   re-rotate by the new one, keep the per-vector scale: R(s*x) = s*R(x), so the scale plane would
//   survive untouched). That reasoning is correct about the SCALE and still WRONG about the CODES:
//   our fp8 K is not stored in the RoPE basis. The append path transforms the row with the
//   normalized Sylvester Hadamard first and quantizes the TRANSFORMED row --
//     ops/kv_cache/append/kernel.cuh:36  normalized_hadamard_d256_inplace(values, lane);  // K only
//     ops/kv_cache/append/kernel.cuh:43  cache_k[...] = kv_cache_fp8_quant_code(values[r], ...);
//   and the attention side transforms Q with the same operator and consumes the stored codes as-is
//     ops/softmax_attention/dense/causal_cache/prompt_fp8.cuh:137 (H on Q), :204 (K codes as stored)
//   so a stored code row is a quantized H*(rope-baked K), not a quantized rope-baked K. H does not
//   commute with the pair rotations of RoPE, so rotating codes in the code domain is not a rotation
//   of K at all. It is not a precision trade-off: it computes the wrong vector.
//   Measured, not asserted -- the standalone verifier keeps the code-domain rotation as a negative
//   control and prints its error against the engine pipeline (see REROPE_SUMMARY, NEG-2). Note the
//   Hadamard-on-K invariant holds for every KV encoding in this tree (fp8, k8v4, nvfp4, i8), so the
//   conclusion is not specific to one dtype.
//
// SO THE ONLY CORRECT PATH IS THE RE-BAKE, and it is also the better one
//   kvmem_rerope_rebake_*: take the RAW (pre-RoPE) K, which the raw-K shadow already keeps
//   (ops/kvmem/raw_k_shadow.*), apply RoPE at the NEW position, narrow to BF16 exactly as the
//   engine's KV tensor would, then run the engine's OWN append pipeline (Hadamard -> row absmax ->
//   fp8 codec) so the bytes are the bytes the engine would have stored had the block lived at the
//   new position all along. Consequences: drift-free by construction (every move is recomputed from
//   the same raw K, so N round trips are byte-identical to a fresh store), and it needs no scale
//   arithmetic of its own -- the engine's codec owns that.
//
// POSITION CONTRACT
//   `win_base` is the ABSOLUTE token position of the block's first token: the token at index `tok`
//   is baked at `win_base + tok` and the bytes are written to the window slots `win_base + tok` of
//   `block_table`. (For a freshly assembled window this is the same number, which is why one base
//   suffices; the block must already sit at those slots.) Addressing goes through the engine's own
//   `paged_kv_element_offset`, so the page layout is never re-derived here.
//   `n_tokens == 0` must produce NO WRITE AT ALL.
//
// GEOMETRY
//   The bake is the engine's fixed Text 1-D D256/R64 theta=1e7 path: dims [0, rope_dim) are rotated
//   in split-half pairs (i, i + rope_dim/2) with kTextRopeInvFrequency[i], dims [rope_dim, 256) are
//   passed through unchanged. kv_heads must be 4 or 2; rope_dim must be even and <= 256.
