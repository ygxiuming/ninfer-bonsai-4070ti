// Host-safe half of the KVMem raw-K shadow (first cut of the KVMem port).
//
// This header is deliberately CUDA-FREE: it carries the A/B switch and the byte arithmetic, and
// nothing else. It is included by host translation units (the op's host side, the runtime call
// site in text_context_impl.h, and the op test), so it must not pull in any device-only header.
//
// Kept separate from the kernel on purpose, exactly like ops/linear/ternary/ternary_s8_scratch.h
// (:3-9) is kept separate from ternary_rowsplit_mma_s8.cuh: including a kernel header from an MSVC
// host TU drags cuda_pipeline_helpers.h in, and the measured failure is
//   "error C2760: syntax error: unexpected token 'volatile', expected 'expression'"
// That is how the first build of the int8 rung broke; the raw-K harvest copies the same split so
// it cannot repeat the mistake. The kernel for this rung lives in raw_k_shadow_launch.cu and has
// no .cuh at all (one TU uses it, so there is nothing for a host TU to include by accident).

// A/B switch for the KVMem raw-K shadow, in the same style as NINFER_TERNARY_S8 / _HADAMARD.
//
//   NINFER_TERNARY_KVMEM=1   -> ON : harvest the raw (pre-RoPE) K of every full-attention layer
//   NINFER_TERNARY_KVMEM=0   -> OFF
//   unset                    -> OFF
//
// Read once per process, because the choice decides whether the harvest's device->device copy is
// issued at all, i.e. what the runtime asks the stream to do on every pass.
//
// POLARITY: the OFF arm is the DEFAULT, unlike NINFER_TERNARY_S8 (whose default is on). The
// reason is that the harvest is a DIAGNOSTIC that costs real resources -- a device->device staging
// copy of [kv_size, tokens] BF16 per full-attention layer per pass (16 layers x 4 MiB at T=2048,
// per the qwen3_6_27b geometry: layers=64 -> 16 full-attention layers, kv_size=1024), plus a pinned
// host buffer of the same size, plus a stream synchronise per drain. A default-ON diagnostic would
// silently change the resource profile of the production engine after a routine rebuild, which is
// the one thing this rung must never do. With the default OFF:
//
//   OFF ARM == THE ENGINE AS IT IS TODAY: bit-for-bit identical model numerics, and zero writes by
//   this rung to anything -- the staging copy is not issued (the call site gates the launch, see
//   raw_k_shadow.h), raw_k_shadow_drain() gates itself on this switch before it copies a single
//   host byte, and the KV pages, the residual stream and the attention inputs are never touched by
//   either path. So the OFF arm costs no device traffic and no host writes.
//
// Flip it to opt-out by changing the lambda body to what ternary_s8_enabled() uses
// (`value == nullptr || std::string(value) != "0"`); nothing else depends on the polarity, but the
// op test re-derives the documented polarity from the environment, so a flip must be deliberate.
//
// WHERE THE SWITCH IS ALLOWED TO BE READ (hard constraint, same discipline as
// ternary_rotation.cpp:45-64): host code ONLY -- this predicate, and raw_k_shadow_drain()'s early
// return. Neither the harvest kernel nor the capacity function below may consult it, so that
//   * the two arms share ONE workspace PLAN: the arena reserves the shadow's bytes in both arms,
//     so switching the feature on cannot move any other tensor's pointer;
//   * the kernel is a single implementation with no branch on the switch.
// The call site (segment 2) reads it, exactly as ternary_s8_scratch.h:22 states for the int8 rung
// ("the choice decides which kernel enters the captured CUDA graph").
