// Ternary PQ2_0 tensor-core path for the LARGE-T regime (prefill, and any batched
// multi-sequence pass): the weight window is staged once per K-chunk and every token
// in the tile streams past it, instead of the small-t kernel's "walk 8 tokens, then
// re-stage the whole weight window".
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS -- the weight-pass law (measured 2026-09-20)
// The small-t kernel puts TOKENS in the outer loop and restages the weight window for
// every 8-token tile, so one forward pass reads the entire weight tensor
// ceil(T/8) times. Measured on the real engine: prefill at T=62 costs 131 ms
// (= 8 passes x 6.70 GiB = 438 GiB/s), and the fitted law over a 14x range of T is
//
//     t ~= 12.31 ms * ceil(T/8) + 44 ms          (<= 6% error, 544 GiB/s at the slope)
//
// while the official runtime on this same card reads the weights about once
// (pp512 = 2087 t/s against our 471-630). The harness carries the same fingerprint:
// the small-t kernel measures 14.56 / 16.50 / 15.58 ms at T = 1 / 3 / 8 -- one pass
// each, flat, which a compute-bound kernel could not be -- and then 22.66 -> 90.00 ms
// from T = 16 to 64, i.e. 2 -> 8 passes, exactly 3.97x against the predicted 4x.
// The same law explains the other two oddities: 5-lane concurrency at 25% efficiency
// (11 tokens do not fit one 8-token tile, so it pays 2 passes) and why attaching MTP
// paid off immediately (a T=3 verify pass already rides one pass).
//
// STRUCTURE -- the one thing two independent sources agree on
//   * A operand (weights): staged once per K-chunk, then reused by ALL tokens.
//   * B operand (activations): double buffered.
//   * K is the outer loop; the token sub-tile is inner.
// Upstream ninfer's q4/q8 rowsplit MMA has exactly this shape (its As[BM*BK] carries
// no stage dimension while Bs[S][BN*BK] does), and Marlin states the same preference
// from the other side (activations served from L2, weights loaded asynchronously and
// evicted immediately so they never pollute it). The small-t kernel here is the
// opposite of both, which is why it caps prefill at one weight pass per 8 tokens.
//
// WHY BK IS ONE GROUP (128) AND NOT 512
// The activation tile costs BK*2 bytes per token per stage: at BK=512 that is
// 1 KB/token/stage, so 48 KB of static shared caps the token tile at ~10 -- which is
// exactly why the shipped kernel chose 8 tokens. At BK=128 it costs 272 B/token/stage,
// which is what buys a 64-token tile. Shared budget (stages = 2):
//   codes 2*4*16*48 = 6144 | act 2*64*136*2 = 34816 | lut 2048 | scales 2*4*16*2 = 256
//   total 43264 B = 42.25 KB  <=  48 KB static  =>  2 CTAs/SM on sm_89 (100 KB/SM).
// (The sizing formula is validated against the shipped kernel: it predicts the
// 38144 B that ptxas reports for the small-t configuration.)
//
// LAYOUT CONTRACTS (same as the small-t kernel -- violating them makes T == 1 look
// perfect while every prefill scrambles):
//   * activations are TOKEN-major: (column, token) lives at token*k + column.
//   * output is token-major too: (row, token) at token*out_row_stride + row.
//   * PQ2_0 packs four 2-bit codes per byte and code c means value (c - 1); the group
//     scale is applied AFTER the mma, per row. With BK == group size there is exactly
//     one scale application per chunk, which is also why that is the natural chunk.

//   * Nsight Compute on this build: Active Warps/Scheduler 2.72 (max 12), No Eligible 77.3%,
//     12 warp-cycles per issued instruction, "Est. Local Speedup 52.49% from occupancy",
//     DRAM at only 19.7%. It reads like a pure occupancy problem.
//   * Raising occupancy to 16 warps/SM (8 warps/CTA + a 128-register cap) made everything
//     WORSE: T=64 went 52.88 -> 70.89 ms (+34%). The register cap is what did it -- this
//     kernel's accumulators alone are acc[8][4] + tmp[8][4] = 64 floats per thread, so the
//     cap spilled (40 B spill stores / 32 B spill loads) and the local-memory traffic cost
//     more than the four extra warps bought.
//   * Occupancy here is NOT free: it has to be earned by making the kernel need fewer
//     registers, not by capping them. The way to do that is a half-tile structure (run 32 of
