# Tests

The retained tests protect current `.ninfer`, numerical operator, target, runtime-transaction,
benchmark-report, and external protocol behavior. Repository verification principles are defined in
[`../AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md); Op contract and CUDA implementation guidance is in
[`../docs/maintainer/op-development.md`](../docs/maintainer/op-development.md).

## Organization

- `artifact/` — Python container, registered layout, quantization, and resource behavior;
- `ops/` — one identifiable qualification suite per semantic Op or closely related overload group,
  using independent numerical/state-transition oracles at real supported shapes;
- `ops/linear/` — weight/activation-profile-specific public Linear conformance tests plus their
  one shared input generator, FP64 GEMM oracle, tolerance registry, and output/effects mechanics;
- `ops/linear_add/`, `ops/linear_pair/`, `ops/linear_swiglu/` — fused-Op suites split by registered
  weight/activation profile, each evaluating its complete formula rather than composing production
  Ops;
- `targets/qwen3_6/` — shared tokenizer/template, multimodal preprocessing, MRoPE, prepared-prompt,
  stop/output decoding, hybrid topology, decoder/GDN and round-state layouts/views, shifted-MTP
  alignment, Vision control, and family runtime mechanisms;
- `targets/qwen3_6_27b/` — registered inventory, converter recipe, source verifier, artifact
  bindings, reference diagnostics, family Program/multimodal/MTP behavior, and the opt-in real-Engine
  prefix test and causal-scoring State/KV isolation test;
- `targets/qwen3_6_35b_a3b/` — registered inventory/converter contracts, artifact-native diagnostic
  reference, MoE oracle, typed binding, selected-expert row access, 256K INT8 memory calculation,
  and the opt-in real public-Engine route;
- `test_ninfer_artifact_reader.cpp` — C++ framing, directory, encoded-size, payload-span, and
  geometry behavior against a self-contained C++ fixture;
- `test_openai_schema.cpp`, `test_openai_responses.cpp`,
  `test_openai_responses_store.cpp`, `test_anthropic_schema.cpp`, and
  `test_tool_call_parser.cpp` — current protocol translation, Responses Item/state/SSE behavior,
  schema-guided tool-argument normalization, structural fallback, and chunk-invariant incremental
  tool-call behavior;
- `test_request_log.cpp` — the consumed request JSONL schema and exact measurement fields, plus
  representative Serve request/throughput pretty records, failure severity, zero-field elision,
  and exclusion of arbitrary client error text;
- `test_pretty_logging.cpp` — observable Service/Tool prefixes and separation of executable identity
  from the human-readable record body;
- `test_http_error_handler.cpp` — protocol-shaped payload-limit errors and application-error
  preservation;
- `test_ninfer_bench_support.cpp` — product benchmark CLI, timing boundary, and schema-v14 reports;
- `test_bench_matrix.py` — schema-v14 report consumption by the Python matrix summarizer;
- `test_serve_corpus.py` — current serving request-log identity at the measurement consumer;
- device/tensor/arena tests — reusable lower-component behavior; KV tests cover the core physical
  container, family runtime tests cover dimension-driven GDN storage/view mechanics, and Op tests
  cover mathematical state transitions at their own boundary.

Tests are grouped by observable risk, not by mirroring every source file or class.
`ops/op_tester.h` and `ops/op_check.h` own only reusable device/guard and comparison mechanics.
Concrete numerical criteria remain named by the semantic Op suite; there are no cross-Op tolerance
presets.

`ops/quantized_weight.h` is the common packed-weight fixture for Q4/Q5/Q6/W8 and NVFP4 Op tests. It
owns deterministic payload generation, device `Weight` views, row views, and independent logical
weight decoding.

## Build and run

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Run a focused target for a localized change:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target ninfer_sampling_test
ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_sampling_test --output-on-failure
```

Enable uniform floating-point error records when establishing or reviewing an Op criterion:

```bash
NINFER_OP_REPORT_STATS=1 \
  ctest --test-dir build -V -R '^ninfer_(rmsnorm|softmax_attention)_test$'
```

Every participating comparison emits one `OP_ERROR_STATS` record containing the stable case label,
actual error, active limit, and error-to-limit ratio. The switch changes reporting only; the same
statistics still drive the normal verdict. Passing tests remain quiet without it.

The variable-width DFlash2 target-attention subset can be run with
`./build/tests/ninfer_softmax_attention_test --dflash2-only`. It covers D256/Q24/KV4 across all five
cache codecs, W=2..16, B=1..8, request-local prefixes, cache effects, and Graph metadata/input
updates. The default executable also runs the existing attention geometries and prefill tests.

Linear tests are independently runnable by weight and activation-compute profile:

```bash
cmake --build build --parallel --target \
  ninfer_linear_q4_a16_test ninfer_linear_q5_a16_test \
  ninfer_linear_q6_a16_test ninfer_linear_w8_a16_test
ctest --test-dir build -R '^ninfer_linear_(q4|q5|q6|w8)_a16_test$' --output-on-failure
```

All Linear files use `ops/linear/linear_test_common.{h,cpp}` and the same
`ops/quantized_weight.h` fixture as the fused projection tests. The fixture produces the complete
packed GPU payload and exact-decodes the logical float rows used by the one
`cpu_linear_gemm_fp64()` reference. The reference performs naive double accumulation and never
reproduces a production route's activation quantization, staging, reduction tree, or BF16 output
rounding. Each activation compute path selects one centrally defined comparison tolerance for its
whole suite; private kernel, schedule, launcher, and T selection do not change it. Individual test
files call public `linear()` and contain no private selector, launcher, schedule, or kernel
assertions.

Run the native Python suites with the project Python environment:

```bash
python3 -m pytest \
  tests/artifact tests/convert \
  tests/test_bench_matrix.py tests/test_serve_corpus.py
```

The Python suites cover generic artifact framing and exact converter inventories, source recipes,
encoders, and payload verification. Model execution and real-artifact binding are tested through
the C++ target and Engine suites below; there is no Python inference implementation. The two
official source-resource preflight checks are opt-in: set `NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_MODEL` and/or
`NINFER_QWEN3_6_35B_A3B_MODEL` to the corresponding source checkpoint directory. Only those
source-dependent checks are skipped when their variable is absent.

The C++ prefix/MTP integration test is separately opt-in because it loads the full artifact and
runs the real engine:

```bash
NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_WEIGHTS=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_prefix_real_test --output-on-failure
```

The causal-scoring integration test uses the same artifact variable and checks a full 1,024-column
score tile, overlapping target suffixes, and repeated-window State/KV isolation:

```bash
NINFER_QWEN3_6_27B_WEIGHTS=$PWD/out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_6_27b_score_real_test --output-on-failure
```

Run the peer 35B-A3B route independently:

```bash
NINFER_QWEN3_6_35B_A3B_WEIGHTS=$PWD/out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer \
  ctest --test-dir build -R ninfer_qwen3_6_35b_a3b_real_test --output-on-failure
```

Without the corresponding variable CTest marks each C++ integration test as skipped. Neither test
uses another numerical/execution path's generated tokens as a golden.

The capability-evaluation coordinator has its own environment and unittest entry point:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=eval eval/.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover \
  -s eval/tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

Run the serving contract manually after starting a resident server in another terminal:

```bash
./build/apps/ninfer-serve out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port 18080
```

```bash
python3 -m tools.smoke.serve_contract \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:18080 --model qwen3.6-27b
```

This smoke check is intentionally not a CTest: it needs the real artifact, a supported GPU, and a
server process that remains alive while the client exercises OpenAI Responses/Chat, Anthropic,
state, streaming, and multimodal requests.

The thinking-preservation fixture starts and stops its own server, submits a fixed two-step tool
history, compares restored and cold greedy output, compares stripped and preserved closed-turn
prompt lengths, and verifies turn/response rewrite-checkpoint reuse paths plus Responses
inheritance:

```bash
python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_27b.ninfer --backend mtp

python3 tools/smoke/serve_thinking_preservation.py \
  --artifact out/qwen3_6_35b_a3b.ninfer --backend dflash
```

The shared messages are in
[`fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json`](fixtures/serve/qwen3_6_thinking_preservation.json).

## What belongs here

A permanent test should protect one current risk, such as:

- exact registered artifact bytes, geometry, object binding, or conversion transform;
- a numerical operator contract with an independent oracle;
- family Frontend or Program frontier, prefix, MTP, or multimodal behavior;
- generated-token commit/stop/cancel consistency;
- public benchmark or OpenAI/Anthropic observable behavior;
- a reproduced supported bug.

Performance-only assertions belong in benchmarks and profiler review. Source scans,
implementation-shape assertions, trivial getters/configuration, retired command surfaces, and
broad additions without a concrete regression risk do not belong in the permanent suite.

## DFlash2 Engine integration

The real test uses one explicit companion artifact and compares a fixed greedy fixture and its
penalty-count variant with ordinary decoding. It also checks compact batches with unequal output
budgets, same-seed stochastic replay, retained/fresh prefix behavior, and absence of a full backend
KV pool. A shared DFlash/DFlash2 fixture starts decode at token 63, verifies across the page
boundary, stops after one target column at token 64, and checks the exact retained frontier and
subsequent generation with and without reuse.
The KV Store test checks exact mapping and reservation accounting for the same transition.
K>=7 also exercises a stop inside a licensed block; K=15 additionally checks oversized prefill,
local ring wrap, and the logical context-capacity tail. Optional Vision runs image/video capture
and prefix restore. Zero extra Device StateImage slots exercise Host snapshot/restore.

```bash
cmake --build build -j --target ninfer_qwen3_8_27b_dflash2_real_test
NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_DFLASH2_WEIGHTS=out/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_qwen3_8_27b_dflash2_real_test 15 1 1 8
NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_DFLASH2_WEIGHTS=out/qwen3_8_27b.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_qwen3_8_27b_dflash2_real_test 7 1 0 2 bf16 1 0
NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_DFLASH2_WEIGHTS=out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4.ninfer \
  build/tests/ninfer_qwen3_8_27b_dflash2_real_test 2 0 0 2 int8
```

Arguments are K, Graph enabled, optimized head enabled, maximum B, target KV (`bf16` or `int8`),
Vision enabled, and extra Device StateImage slots. Defaults are `15 1 1 8 bf16 0 3`. Run GPU
integration tests serially. The individual Op suites remain the numerical/state-transition oracle;
the fixed Engine fixture does not define bit parity across arbitrary floating-point routes.

The old/new Qwen3.8 binding matrix uses `out/qwen3_8_27b_old.ninfer` and
`out/qwen3_8_27b_nvfp4_old.ninfer` for the legacy inventories, and the canonical filenames above
for the companion artifacts. The legacy paths may be overridden with
`NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_OLD_WEIGHTS` and `NINFER_QWEN3_8_27B_NVFP4_OLD_WEIGHTS`.
