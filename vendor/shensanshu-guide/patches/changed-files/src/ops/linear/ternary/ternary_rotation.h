// Folded (rotated) ternary basis support for the Prism/Bonsai ports.
//
// The ternary linear weights are stored folded into a rotated basis, so the model computes
//
//     y = W' * (H * (s * P * x))
//
// where P is an optional column permutation (only the GDN output projection carries one), s is
// an explicit +-1 diagonal, and H is the normalized Sylvester-Hadamard transform over blocks of
// 1024. Everything below is driven by data the binder already attached to Weight
// (hadamard_signs / hadamard_n_blk / hadamard_perm_*), so the op layer never needs to know which
// model layers are folded: `qtype` alone decides.
//
// The transform is applied to the ACTIVATION, never to the weight. Folding H and s back into W
// would make W a dense float matrix (`W = W' * H * s`), which is not ternary representable and
// would re-inflate the artifact from 7 GB to ~17 GB -- the exact failure mode this port exists
// to avoid.

// True when this weight's activation must be mapped into the folded basis. False for every
// non-ternary weight, which is why the non-ternary pipelines are unaffected.

// NINFER_TERNARY_HADAMARD=0 disables the transform at run time.
//
// This is the bisection switch between the two ways an end-to-end ternary run can be wrong:
// decode errors (wrong codes / wrong scale / wrong row order) and rotation errors (wrong
// butterfly, wrong sign row, wrong permutation). With the transform off, the engine still runs
// the full forward pass and still reports a decode speed, so the M4 throughput number can be
// measured before the transform is trusted; the output is numerically meaningless either way,
// and a perplexity that is *not* in the hundreds is the signal that the rotation is correct.

// Whether the folded GDN feature permutation P is applied.
//
// llama.cpp applies P because ITS runtime keeps the GDN V channels tiled, matching the GGUF's
// `attn_qkv` row order, while the folded `ssm_out` keeps its training (grouped) column order
// (`conversion/qwen.py:617-626`). The GGUF metadata records this as
// `prism.hadamard.gdn_v_grouped = 1` -- "v is already grouped, do not permute a second time".
//
// This port's packer normalizes EVERY GDN tensor to the grouped (HF) order: `gdn/value_z` applies
// tiled->grouped to the attn_qkv V rows and to attn_gate, and `ssm_conv1d`/`ssm_alpha`/`ssm_beta`
// are reordered the same way. The runtime therefore already produces grouped V, so applying P here
// permutes a SECOND time and scrambles 48 of the 64 layers.
//
// Default: off. NINFER_TERNARY_GDN_PERM=1 restores the llama.cpp behaviour, which is what a
// tile-ordered artifact would need.

// is the same transform with the sign multiply on the other side.
